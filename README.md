# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Overview:- This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn Dataset, which includes customer demographics, account details, and service usage patterns. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify key factors influencing customer retention and develop models that can predict whether a customer is likely to leave.
